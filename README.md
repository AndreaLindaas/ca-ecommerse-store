This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.

## REPORT




[Figma](https://www.figma.com/file/zUl3CM1S71TCYd7YGV1Q4S/ecommerse-design?type=design&node-id=0%3A1&mode=design&t=rXU0nrzAGOgTI5kb-1)


This e-commerse CA was made by Andrea & Alex in a nextjs project with typescript.

We used netlify for hosting and zustand for managing states. Andrea did most of the CA as Alex was afk due to illness in family. We also chose a mix of tailwind and regular css to style our project. 
When it comes to the design its not fully done yet, we know its fault and we are in the proccess of making it a much nicer UX experience than it is right now. 

The validation for the form should come after inputed value, right now it shows as instructions in the beginning, its an approach we wanted to  try - might not be our choice for the future. 

The navbar is chosen for it cleanlyness and it does not take up more space than needed, we chose to center it for it to "fill up" the empty space it mightÂ´ve had if we put it on one of the sides.

Overall we achieved the learning outcome and know we know how to make a cart for shopping.
